# mandelbrother

This is a simple GPU accelerated Mandelbrot set visualizer which uses moderngl through python to render in realtime.

You can pan with the arrow keys and zoom in and out with "a" and "z", respectively.

I'd love to add infinite zoom in the future, but for now it's limited by floating point precision.
